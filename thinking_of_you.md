Thinking of you, wherever you are. 
We pray for our sorrows to end, and hope that our hearts will blend. 
Now I will step forward to realize this wish. 
And who knows: starting a new journey may not be so hard, or maybe it has already begun. 
There are many worlds, and they share the same sky - one sky, one destiny
-Kairi
