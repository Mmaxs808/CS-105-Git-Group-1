Your domestic life may be harmonious.
You never hesitate to tackle the most difficult problems.
Do not overtax your powers.
Ships are safe in harbor, but they were never meant to stay there.
Accent on helpful side of your nature.  Drain the moat.
They spell it "da Vinci" and pronounce it "da Vinchy".  Foreigners
always spell better than they pronounce.
		-- Mark Twain
